## KNOWN BUGS/THINGS TO IMPROVE
currently, there is a bug where some album titles are interpreted as ids, 
and displayed incorrectly because of that and the ways ids are formatted. 
This can be fixed by using a json parser for C, instead of manually processing the strings, 
which I'm doing now. Using a json library would also make this program more generalizable to other formatting styles.
